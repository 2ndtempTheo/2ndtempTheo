## Hi there, I'm Theo 👋

Aspiring **Data Analyst / IT Generalist** with a Master’s in IT (AI & Data Intelligence). I’m building a hands-on portfolio and looking to **collaborate on real-world datasets and small projects** to sharpen my skills and deliver value.

> If you’ve got a dataset or a small analysis/automation you’d like help with, I’m open to **volunteer/learning-focused contributions**.

* Turning coursework and personal tools into **clear, reproducible repos**
* Practicing **Python (pandas, matplotlib)** and **SQL** on public datasets
* Building a small **data-automation toolkit** (Excel/Sheets + Python + Make.com)
